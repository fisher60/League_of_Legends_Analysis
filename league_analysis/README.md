# Project Goals

1. Create a wide range of analysis methods, including ones not perfectly suited for the task at hand in an effort to explore various analysis 
methods and provide an example of how these methods can be used.

2. Compare the various analysis methods, measuring speed and accuracy.

3. Combine analysis methods to condense data to meaningful values that can be run through further, 
more involved analysis in an effort to both improve accuracy and also speed up calculations as much as reasonable.
